I wish I knew what was that


It seems it is resolving conflicts in a file for example.


Imagine that there is a file, which contains: "a". 
I and you downloed onmine and your achine.
Imagine that I add an "b" in a file.
Imagine that you add an "c" in a file.
Then I commit.
Then you whan to commit. 
You will see a conflict.

Your file has "ac".
The file on the server has "ab".

b and c make a conflict. If you merge "b" and "c" the result is resolving the conflict.

Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.
